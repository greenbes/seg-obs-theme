4. Created obsidian.css file for backward compatibility
5. Simplified theme name from "SEG Modified Dracula" to "SEG-Modified-Dracula" (removed spaces)

- Fixed README.md GitLabâ†’GitHub references
- Added environment documentation to CLAUDE.md
- Created proper theme folder structure in Obsidian

### Update - June 25, 2025 - 15:00

**Summary**: Completely rebuilt theme folder with clean JSON generation to resolve Obsidian detection issues

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/sessions/2025-06-25-1432.md, CLAUDE.md
- Current branch: main (commit: dfedb9e)

**Todo Progress**: 5 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- âœ“ Completed: Remove CLAUDE.md from Obsidian theme folder
- âœ“ Completed: Remove extra newline from manifest.json
- âœ“ Completed: Verify theme folder structure matches working themes
- âœ“ Completed: Test theme recognition in Obsidian
- âœ“ Completed: Investigate deeper JSON or content issues preventing theme detection

**Issues Encountered**:
- Theme folder became corrupted with nested subdirectories during troubleshooting
- Previous manifest.json may have had encoding or character issues despite appearing correct
- Multiple restart/reindex attempts failed to detect theme

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Completely removed and recreated theme folder from scratch
2. Used `jo` command to generate clean JSON manifest without any potential encoding issues
3. Verified folder structure exactly matches working Dracula Official theme
4. Ensured only essential files present: manifest.json + theme.css

**Code Changes Made**:
- Regenerated manifest.json using `jo` tool for guaranteed clean JSON
- Rebuilt theme folder at `/Users/stevengreenberg/obsidian/SEG Notes/.obsidian/themes/seg-obs-theme/`
- Removed any extraneous files or corrupted subdirectories

### Update - June 25, 2025 - 15:15

**Summary**: Identified directory naming issue as root cause - hyphens in folder names prevent Obsidian theme detection

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/sessions/2025-06-25-1432.md, CLAUDE.md
- Added: screenshot.png
- Current branch: main (commit: dfedb9e)

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 0 in progress, 0 pending
- âœ“ Completed: Test with completely different theme name to isolate naming issues

**Breakthrough Discovery**:
- Created minimal test theme "test2" with basic manifest and CSS
- Test2 theme successfully appeared in Obsidian themes list
- This confirmed theme detection mechanism works correctly
- Issue was NOT with JSON format, encoding, or file structure

**Root Cause Identified**:
- Directory name `seg-obs-theme` with hyphens prevents Obsidian from detecting theme
- Hyphens in theme folder names appear to be incompatible with Obsidian's theme scanner

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Renamed directory from `seg-obs-theme` to `segobstheme` (removed hyphens)
2. Updated manifest.json name field to match: "segobstheme"
3. Maintained all other theme content and structure

**Code Changes Made**:
- Created test theme at `/Users/stevengreenberg/obsidian/SEG Notes/.obsidian/themes/test2/`
- Renamed main theme directory to remove hyphens
- Updated manifest.json with hyphen-free name

### Update - June 25, 2025 - 15:25

**Summary**: Successfully resolved theme detection issue and initiated repository rename process

**Git Changes**:
- Modified: .claude/sessions/2025-06-25-1432.md, CLAUDE.md
- Added: screenshot.png
- Current branch: main (commit: dfedb9e)

**Todo Progress**: 1 completed, 1 in progress, 2 pending
- âœ“ Completed: Rename GitHub repository from seg-obs-theme to segdrac
- ðŸ”„ In Progress: Rename local directory and update remote URL to segdrac

**Major Success**:
- **THEME IS NOW WORKING!** Obsidian successfully detects and loads the theme after removing hyphens from directory name
- Theme appears in Obsidian settings as "segobstheme" and functions correctly
- Root cause confirmed: Obsidian will not recognize themes with hyphens in directory names

**Repository Rename Process**:
- User successfully renamed GitHub repository from `seg-obs-theme` to `segdrac`
- Next: Local directory rename and remote URL update (pending user action due to directory access restrictions)
- This ensures consistency between repository name and Obsidian's hyphen-free naming requirements

**Key Learning**:
- Obsidian theme directory names cannot contain hyphens
- Repository names should follow same pattern to avoid future conflicts
- Systematic testing approach (minimal test theme) was crucial for isolating the issue
